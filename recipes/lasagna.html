      <p>
        This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty,
        made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more
        traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my
        mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and
        Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green
        salad and crusty garlic bread.

        <h2 class="title-red">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
          <li>
            Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over
            medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7
            minutes.
          </li>
          <li>Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
          <li>
            Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley,
            garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low
            and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted
            water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring
            occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes.
            Drain and set aside. While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven
            to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
          </li>
          <li>
            Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon
            fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.
          </li>
          <li>
            Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of
            a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of
            noodles over the sauce to cover.
          </li>
          <li>
            Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce,
            and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the
            remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the
            baking dish with aluminum foil.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and
            bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and
            serving.
          </li>
