      <p>
        Pasta fazool is a classic Italian-American comfort food. This recipe
        works with any sausage, but I like the fennel and anise flavors of sweet
        Italian sausage with the beans. A hearty soup that's fast and easy to
        put together. This recipe makes enough for two large portions or four
        smaller ones.

        <ol>
          <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
          <li>
            Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage
            in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, about 5 minutes.
            Reduce heat to medium. Add diced celery and chopped onion. Cook
            until onions are translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add dry pasta; cook
            and stir for 2 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stir in tomato paste until evenly distributed, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour
            in 3 cups broth; increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Stir in
            red pepper flakes, oregano, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to medium
            and let simmer, stirring often, for about 5 minutes. Add more broth
            if needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place chopped chard in a bowl. Cover with cold water and rinse
            leaves; any grit will fall to the bottom of the bowl. Transfer chard
            to a colander to drain briefly; add to soup. Cook and stir until
            leaves wilt, 2 to 3 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stir in white beans; continue cooking and stirring until pasta is
            tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in grated cheese.
            Serve topped with additional grated cheese.
          </li>
          <li>Enjoy!</li>
